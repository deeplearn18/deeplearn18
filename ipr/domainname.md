Metaverse: Don’t mess with Roblox

Back in November, we heard in the halls of Web Summit — the 42,000 in-person tech global event in Lisbon — that in a way the metaverse is already here (Roblox’s Global Head of Music had some thoughts on virtual concerts). But we’re still far from the promise of almost living in the virtual world that books like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash or Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One showed us.

Oculus shipped a lot of headsets and there are immersive experiences out there that are Metaverse-like (a step further than the now-usual-for-most spending all day working, learning, communicating through a screen) and we focused on that ones, like Fortnite, Roblox, Second Life (the oldest, from 2003), Minecraft and Oculus. But Oculus.com doesn’t have enough direct traffic (playing games using Oculus headset could direct the traffic elsewhere) to be in our top 100k domains ranking, and the same happens with Minecraft.

Oculus.com and Minecraft.net are not in our 100,000 ranking

Top — Most popular metaverse domains (late) 2020

1 Epicgames.com (Fortnite)
2 Roblox.com
3 Secondlife.com

Oculus.com and Minecraft.net are not in our 100,000 ranking

The (short) list from 2020 and 2021 shows us that Roblox.com surpassed Epicgames.com (the home of the popular Fortnite) for the first time in July reaching back then #27 in our list. But it was after late September that it was consistently in front of the rival game platform, ending the year on a good note reaching #20 in our ranking.

Conclusion: Human (online) trends

The Internet is not a quiet place, the same way humans on Earth (especially during a pandemic) aren’t quiet or passive but active and reactive. Although on the top of our domain ranking there don’t seem to be drastic ups and downs throughout the year (TikTok, and YouTube, were the exceptions), we saw how an event like the Myanmar coup and the subsequent viral video may have brought YouTube to #1 on our ranking. We also saw how e-commerce was affected throughout the year, how space-related websites had a big (online) year with important events, and how Netflix rose around Christmas time.
